# Background
This repository is a fork of the sample code found on the OCLC Research Website. 
http://www.oclc.org/research/themes/data-science/naco.html

The goal of this fork is to bring this package into pep8 compliance, add a suite of 
tests and to make it easier to deploy in a variety of settings.
